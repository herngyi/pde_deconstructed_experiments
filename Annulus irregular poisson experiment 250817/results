the graph on the upper side of figure1 is with aniso [0.1,0] which means the triangles meshes are first surpressed 
in the x direction by 0.1 then stretched in the x direction by 10. Comparing to the second graph on the lower side
of figure 1 the meshes it gerenates is not very bad. From the graph we can see that all three methods converges while
the ground truth given by the refined mesh is the fastest.
We get a similar result when we change the parameter aniso to [0.05,0] which means the triangles meshes are first surpressed 
in the x direction by 0.05 then stretched in the x direction by 1/0.05. The difference is that the worse mesh ([0.05,0])
converges slower (which is the same as the laplace experiment) in all three methods when avg edge length of the mesh decreases.
Comparing to the good meshes, the bad meshes do converge but the good meshes perform a little better. In other words,
the good meshes converge at a faster rate which is what we expected.
